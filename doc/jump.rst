JuMP --- Julia for Mathematical Programming
===========================================

.. module:: JuMP
   :synopsis: Julia for Mathematical Programming

`JuMP <https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl>`_ is a domain-specific modeling language for 
`mathematical programming <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization>`_ 
embedded in `Julia <http://julialang.org/>`_. It currently supports a number
of open-source and commercial solvers (`COIN Clp <https://projects.coin-or.org/Clp>`_,
`COIN Cbc <https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc>`_, `GNU GLPK <http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/>`_,
and `Gurobi <http://www.gurobi.com>`_) via a generic solver-independent 
interface provided by the `MathProgBase <https://github.com/mlubin/MathProgBase.jl>`_
package. One the best features of JuMP is its speed - benchmarking has shown
that it can create problems at similar speeds to special-purpose modeling
languages such as `AMPL <http://www.ampl.com/>`_ while maintaining the expressiveness
of a generic high-level programming language.

If you are familiar with Julia you can get started quickly by using the
package manager to install JuMP::

    julia> Pkg.add("JuMP")

And a solver, e.g.::

    julia> Pkg.add("Clp")  # Will install Cbc as well

Then read the :ref:`quick-start` and/or see a :ref:`simple-example`. We also
have details of the functions and types defined by JuMP.
If you are new to Julia or want more details, read on to the next section.
