Variables

Variables, also known as columns or decision variables, are the results of the optimization.

Constructors
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The primary way to create variables is with the ``@defVar`` macro.
The first argument will always be a ``Model``. In the examples below we assume
``m`` is already defined. The second argument is an expression that declares
the variable name and optionally allows specification of lower and upper bounds.
Adding variables "column-wise", e.g., as in column generation, is supported as well;
see the syntax discussed in the :ref:`probmod` section.

::

    @defVar(m, x )              # No bounds
    @defVar(m, x >= lb )        # Lower bound only (note: 'lb <= x' is not valid)
    @defVar(m, x <= ub )        # Upper bound only
    @defVar(m, lb <= x <= ub )  # Lower and upper bounds

All these variations create a new local variable, in this case ``x``. 
The names of your variables must be valid Julia variable names.
Integer and binary restrictions can optionally be specified with a third argument, ``Int`` or ``Bin``.

To create arrays of variables we append brackets to the variable name.

::

    @defVar(m, x[1:M,1:N] >= 0 )

will create an ``M`` by ``N`` array of variables. Both ranges and arbitrary
iterable sets are supported as index sets. Currently we only support ranges
of the form ``a:b`` where ``a`` is an explicit integer, not a variable. Using
ranges will generally be faster than using arbitrary symbols. You can mix both
ranges and lists of symbols, as in the following example::

    s = ["Green","Blue"]
    @defVar(m, x[-10:10,s] , Int)
    x[-4,"Green"]

Bounds can depend on variable indices::

    @defVar(m, x[i=1:10] >= i )

Finally, variables can be constructed manually, one-by-one::

    x = Variable(m::Model, lower::Number, upper::Number, category::Int, name::String)
    x = Variable(m::Model, lower::Number, upper::Number, category::Int)

but this is not considered idiomatic JuMP code.

Methods
^^^^^^^

**Bounds**

* ``setLower(x::Variable, lower::Number)``, ``getLower(x::Variable)`` - Set/get the lower bound of a variable.
* ``setUpper(x::Variable, upper::Number)``, ``getUpper(x::Variable)`` - Set/get the upper bound of a variable.

**Values**

* ``getValue(x)`` - Get the value of this variable in the solution. If ``x`` is a single variable, this will simply return a number. If ``x`` is indexable then it will return an indexable dictionary of values.
* ``setValue(x,v)`` - Provide an initial value ``v`` for this variable that can be used by supporting MILP solvers. If ``v`` is ``NaN``, the solver may attempt to fill in this value to construct a feasible solution.
* ``getDual(x)`` - Get the reduced cost of this variable in the solution. Similar behavior to ``getValue`` for indexable variables.

**Names**

Variables (in the sense of columns) can have internal names (different from the Julia variable name) that can be used for writing models to file. This feature is disabled for performance reasons, but will be added if there is demand or a special use case.

* ``setName(x::Variable, newName)``, ``getName(x::Variable)`` - Set/get the variable's internal name.
